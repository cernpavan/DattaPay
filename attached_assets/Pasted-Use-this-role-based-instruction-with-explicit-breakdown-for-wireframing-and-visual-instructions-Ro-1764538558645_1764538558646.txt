Use this role-based instruction with explicit breakdown for wireframing and visual instructions:

Role:
World-Class Product Designer — Modern Fintech, specializing in next-generation international payments and yield.

Objective:
Design a premium, Stripe-inspired UI for a new fintech product replacing a legacy experience. The platform should empower freelancers and creators globally to receive USD/EUR payments, instantly convert to stablecoins (USDC/USDT), and earn yield—clearly positioning the product as the best-in-class, fastest, and most trustworthy.

Context:

Target users: Freelancers/creators worldwide needing to accept global payments, shield against home-currency volatility, and maximize earnings.

Key flows: Receiving client payments in USD/EUR, instant stablecoin payouts, yield staking, balance/yield visualization

Flat universal fee: 0.5% (should be highly visible).

Modern, “international” but approachable and warm style.

Instructions:
Develop a structured, wireframe-level UI outline for this product, inspired by Stripe, Ramp, Brex, and Circle. Detail primary flows, core screens, UI elements, and suggested copy for key messages. Highlight visual and interaction cues, aesthetic guidelines, and modern design standards.

Output format:

List each primary screen with a numbered heading.

For each, detail:

Core user flow (step-by-step)

Key UI Components (inputs, cards, buttons, stats, graphs)

Suggested copy for critical actions/call-outs

Visual/aesthetic guidance (shapes, color cues, font styles, layout)

Brand inspiration (Stripe/Brex reference)

Include a summary Style/Component Guide section with:

Palette specification (with hex/RGB as guidance)

Font guidance (reference Stripe, Circle)

Button, card, and form field shapes/styles

Elevation, motion, and grid suggestions

Accessibility and localization cues

End with concise suggestions to “raise the bar” beyond Cacao’s example.

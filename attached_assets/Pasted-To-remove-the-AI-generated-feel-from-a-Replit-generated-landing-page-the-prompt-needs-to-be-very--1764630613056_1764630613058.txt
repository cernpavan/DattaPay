To remove the “AI-generated” feel from a Replit-generated landing page, the prompt needs to be very specific about layout, visuals, content tone, and imperfections.  Here is a single, reusable prompt you can paste into Replit’s Design/AI mode and then tweak over time.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Prompt to humanize your Replit landing page

“Act as a senior product designer at a modern fintech startup. Redesign the existing landing page with a human-crafted feel, avoiding generic AI patterns.

Goals:
- Make the page feel opinionated, premium, and personality-driven, not like a generic template.
- Prioritize clarity, hierarchy, and narrative flow over flashy effects.

Brand and visual direction:
- Brand style: Stripe + Brex + Ramp inspired, but not copied; clean, confident, minimal, with subtle depth and warmth.
- Color: 1 primary brand color, 1 accent, and a mostly neutral background. Avoid loud gradients and rainbow effects. Use solid fills and very subtle gradients only in hero or key CTAs.
- Typography: Use a clear, professional sans-serif font stack with:
  - Distinctive but readable H1 and H2 sizes.
  - Body text at a comfortable reading size with slightly increased line-height.
  - Limited font weights (e.g., 400, 500, 600) and clear hierarchy.
- Layout: Use a 12-column grid, generous whitespace, and consistent spacing tokens (e.g., 8/12/16/24/32px). Avoid edge-to-edge sections with no breathing room.

Structure:
- Header: Left-aligned logo, center or right-aligned nav with 3–4 concise links, and a single primary CTA. Use a sticky header with a subtle bottom border instead of heavy shadows.
- Hero: 
  - One clear H1 that states the core value in simple language.
  - Short supporting sentence (no buzzword salad).
  - One primary CTA and one secondary text link (no more than two actions).
  - One focused visual: a dashboard mock, card UI, or device frame that feels like a real product screenshot, not an abstract AI blob.
- Social proof: Row of 4–6 small, low-contrast logos with “Trusted by …” text. Keep it subtle.
- Features: 3 key benefit blocks in a single row or 2x2 grid with:
  - Short, concrete titles.
  - One-sentence descriptions with specific outcomes (e.g., “Get paid in 2 days, not 2 weeks”).
  - Simple line icons or minimal illustrations, consistent in style.
- Narrative section: A horizontal band that explains “How it works” in 3 steps with numbers and short, plain-language descriptions.
- Testimonial: One primary testimonial with:
  - A real-sounding name, role, and company.
  - A short, conversational quote in plain English (avoid overhyped phrases).
  - Small avatar or initials in a circle.
- Final CTA/footer: A simple, focused CTA section followed by a clean footer with compact navigation, social links, and legal text.

Tone and copy:
- Write all copy in natural, human, slightly conversational language aimed at freelancers and creators in emerging markets.
- Avoid filler phrases like “revolutionize,” “cutting-edge,” “AI-powered,” or long buzzword chains.
- Use specific, grounded phrasing and real-world outcomes (e.g., “Get paid in USD from global clients, even if your bank is local”).
- Make headlines and buttons concrete and benefit-driven, not vague (e.g., “Start accepting global payments” instead of “Get started”).

Humanizing details:
- Introduce tiny, realistic variations in spacing and card heights so the layout feels designed, not perfectly symmetrical, while still polished.
- Use microcopy on forms and buttons that sounds like a real product team wrote it (e.g., helper text, error hints).
- Add small touches like:
  - A single, subtle hover effect on CTAs (background darken + slight scale).
  - Soft shadows only on key cards or mockups, very restrained.
- Avoid: default gradient blobs, glassmorphism, neon glows, spinning 3D shapes, or overly generic “AI illustration” imagery.

Implementation constraints:
- Use semantic HTML and clean, BEM-style or utility-first CSS, avoiding inline styles.
- Keep the design cohesive and minimal—no more than 3 section background treatments on the whole page.
- Make the layout responsive with a clear mobile breakpoint:
  - Stack content vertically.
  - Keep typography sizes and spacing tuned for mobile.

Now, using these guidelines, refactor the current landing page code. Keep the existing product idea and key sections, but:
- Replace any generic copy with concrete, specific text for a fintech product that helps freelancers and creators in Africa and LATAM receive international payments.
- Remove or redesign any AI-ish artifacts (gradient blobs, random neon shapes, overly symmetrical card grids, generic hero illustrations).
- Return the full updated HTML and CSS for the page.”
